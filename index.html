    <h1>Welcome! üòä</h1>
    <p>Thanks for taking part in our chatbot experiment.</p>
    <p>You will be holding a 5 minutes conversation with the chatbot. During this conversation, please talk to the chatbot about a stressful event that has occured recently, and explain how you dealt with it or even ask the chatbot for advice! The contents of the conversation will remain private and anonymized.</p>
    <p>Below are the instructions to help guide you through the process. Please follow each step carefully to ensure everything runs smoothly.</p>

    <h2>üßæ Step 1: Enter Your Name</h2>
    <p>You'll start by entering your name. This is optional! Your name will only be stored if you'd like us to remember your session id.</p>

    <h2>üÜî Step 2: Choose How to Handle Your Session ID</h2>
    <p>You'll be assigned a session ID. This ID links to your conversation content so that the chatbot can access it later during the actual experiment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you want us to store the ID, no problem ‚Äî we'll handle it for you. Please be sure to enter your name in Step 1 if that's the case.</li>
        <li>If you'd prefer to keep it private, you can write it down and keep it yourself. Totally up to you!</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you choose to store it yourself, keep it safe! You'll need it for the actual experiment later.</p>

    <h2>üì∏ Step 3: Camera Access</h2>
    <p>Next, you'll be asked to grant access to your webcam. This is so the chatbot can read facial expressions to better understand your emotional state during the conversation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the camera panel.</li>
        <li>Allow browser access when prompted.</li>
        <li>Hit the <strong>Record</strong> button and let it run.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Please <u>do not stop the recording</u> ‚Äî the video feed is only used to extract emotional cues and is never saved. It's processed on the spot and deleted right after. ‚ú®</p>

    <h2>üí¨ Step 4: Start Chatting</h2>
    <p>You'll now chat with the bot for about 5 minutes. Just talk naturally! The session will end automatically, and you'll see a message when it's over. No need to do anything else.</p>

    <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Final Reminders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Please don't refresh the page</strong>. It'll reset your session and you'll have to start over from the beginning.</li>
        <li>Follow the steps in the order they appear for everything to work correctly.</li>
        <li>Most importantly: relax, be yourself, and speak openly üòä</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="tip">If you ever get lost or something breaks, feel free to reach out to us for help. We're here to make sure everything goes smoothly!</p>
